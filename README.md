# HalfCat

### Check it out: [HalfCat](http://halfcat.herokuapp.com/)

Halfcat is a SoundCloud-like website for music streaming. It uses the SoundCloud API to allow users to search for music on the SoundCloud platform and stream it.

This project was created as a homework assignment for my **Internet Technoligies** university course. The assignment had one major constraint: we could only use **"vanilla" JavaScript/HTML/CSS/PHP** to develop the website. This means **NO** frameworks like **Bootstrap** or any kind of tools such as **SQL/No-SQL databases** were allowed.
